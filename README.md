# Fibonacci Sequence

## Name
FiboCalc (Fibonacci Calculator)

## Description
FiboCalc is a Python-based tool designed to simplify and automate the generation of Fibonacci sequences for educational and computational purposes. This project provides a simple interface for calculating the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence, along with options for displaying sequences up to a specified term. The project is ideal for beginners who want to learn more about recursion, input handling, and basic algorithms.

    Features:
    - Calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
    - Display the full Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term.
    - Error handling for invalid user inputs.
    - Recursive and iterative implementations.

    Background:
    Fibonacci sequences are a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. They have applications in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and even art.

## Installation
To install and run MyAwesomeProject, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository:

    git clone [https://git.cs.dal.ca/nnadede/fibonacci-sequence.git](https://git.cs.dal.ca/nnadede/fibonacci-sequence.git)

2) Navigate to the project directory:

    cd fibonacci-sequence

3) Run the Python script:

    python fiboCalc.py

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 
- No additional dependencies

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub Issues page or contact me via email at nn454994@dal.ca.

## Roadmap
- Version 2.0: Add support for custom starting values.
- Version 3.0: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Version 4.0: Optimize the algorithm for large sequences.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
